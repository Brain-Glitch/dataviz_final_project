## Mini-Project 1

Descrtiption of your project goes here. 
You can include a motivation, summary of findings, and description of the data below.

This project was used to illustrate a flaw in the traffic_MN datasheet. Namely, that the "holiday" section is only labeled at midnight, when the holiday lasts all day. Now, there is a dip in the number of cars during a holiday rather than the surrounding days. However, it is far less drastic than the one a generic summary presents. There is some interesting sub-information, like how certain holidays have less traffic than others, but the important point is that a generic summary exacerbates a trend that is actually relatively minor.

I am using a subsection of the traffic_MN dataset that includes the date, time, number of cars, and regestered holiday.
