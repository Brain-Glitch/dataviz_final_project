## Mini-Project 2

The trend I found interesting enough to show was how the day of the week correlated to birth rate. Unfortunately, since this data did not have a geographic element or benefit significantly from annotations when graphed, I tacked on a visualization of the various countries Boston Marathon runners come from to fulfill the assignment requirements.

It is possible to segment the birth rate data along other axes, and the Boston marathon data by American state, though neither is necessary to tell a story with the data. It would also invite more issues than I already dealt with. IN one case, the line chart refuse to acknowledge "day of the week." In another, the map took several minutes of minor tweaks to it's color to even look halfway presentable.

However, on the whole, it was easy enough to apply broad design principles to the assignment. Cutting down on axis labels and grid lines when possible, using titles instead of axis labels, and using colors that roughly translate the emotion of the data (red for poor relationships, green for large numbers, etc). Though I would have liked to cut down on some of the white space, and the fonts do feel somewhat generic, the data comes across as intended, so I feel good about my work.
